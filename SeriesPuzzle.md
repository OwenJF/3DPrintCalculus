# Signature Project: Convergent Series Puzzle

I designed this puzzle in TinkerCAD. It features several square pieces that fit into the base. The sizes of the pieces are based on the geometric series $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n$, the idea being that each piece is half the size of the last piece, starting from 1. The pieces all fit into a base that contains the same summation notation. Since the series is infinite, I only have pieces that go up to 1/256 and then a piece labeled ${\infty}$ to represent the rest of the series. All of the pieces fit into a space that is 2 times the area of the first piece, which shows that the convergent sum of the series is 2.

This puzzle is a useful teaching tool for series because it provides a tangible representation of a convergent series. It is also somewhat of a mind challenge because it is not immediately obvious how the pieces all fit into the base.
