#Signature Project: Brachistochrone Curve Marble Run

###What is a Brachistochrone Curve?
In physics and mathematics, a brachistochrone curve (from Ancient Greek βράχιστος χρόνος (brákhistos khrónos) 'shortest time'),[1] or curve of fastest descent, is the one lying on the plane between a point A and a lower point B, where B is not directly below A, on which a bead slides frictionlessly under the influence of a uniform gravitational field to a given endpoint in the shortest time. The problem was posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696.

###More About the Project
To demonstrate a Brachistochrone curve, I wanted to create a series of ramps for a marble run. The design was a collaborative effort between Su, Nyi, and I. I got the models for the curves and put them together in TinkerCAD with rails and a fork-like stopper to ensure that each marble could be released at the same time.

Three marbles are placed at the top, then the fork is pulled out to start the marbles going. The drop is fast, so it is best to record a slow-motion video to see the balls drop. In most cases, if everything is done right. The marble on the Brachistochrone path should reach the bottom first.
