# 3DPrintCalculus
3D Printing Stuff for my Calculus II Class

First Project: SinPlot - Reiman Sum:
  - This project is a 3D representation of the Reimann sum of a sin plot. I changed the parameters from the original Mathematica code to create three different versions of the sin plot, each with a different number of rectangles for the Reimann sum.

Second Project: Solid of Revolution/Shells:
- This project is a 3D representation of a solid of revolution. This code can generate the exact solid, represent the disk method, or generate both. I used the code to generate both 3D shapes. I repaired 3D objects in Fusion 360 then added text in TinkerCad before printing.
