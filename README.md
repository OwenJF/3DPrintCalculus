# 3DPrintCalculus
3D Printing Stuff for my Calculus II Class

First Project: SinPlot - Reiman Sum:
  - This project is a 3D representation of the Reimann sum of a sin plot. I changed the parameters from the original Mathematica code to create three different versions of the sin plot, each with a different number of rectangles for the Reimann sum.

Second Project: Solid of Revolution/Shells:
- This project is a 3D representation of a solid of revolution. This code can generate the exact solid, represent the disk method, or generate both. I used the code to generate both 3D shapes. I repaired 3D objects in Fusion 360 then added text in TinkerCad before printing.

Third Project: Centroid Center of Mass:
- Extrusion of function y=Sqrt(x) with the centroid calculated in Mathematica. Printed with no walls and 100% infill with the goal of actually having a well-balanced shape

Fourth Project: Washer Method Vase:
- Like solid of revolution but uses the washer method. The function x^2 is subtracted from x + 2sin(x) + 1. I had to do some work in Fusion 360 to make the Mathematica output 3D-printable.
- I have also stretched the vase vertically to make it more practical. (see SolidRevVase ... taller.3mf)
