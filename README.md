## 3D Printing Projects for my Calculus II Class

### First Project - SinPlot - Reiman Sum:
  - This project is a 3D representation of the Reimann sum of a sin plot. I changed the parameters from the original Mathematica code to create three different versions of the sin plot, each with a different number of rectangles for the Reimann sum.

### Second Project - Solid of Revolution/Shells:
- This project is a 3D representation of a solid of revolution. This code can generate the exact solid, represent the disk method, or generate both. I used the code to generate both 3D shapes. I repaired 3D objects in Fusion 360 then added text in TinkerCad before printing.

### Third Project - Centroid Center of Mass:
- Extrusion of function $y=\sqrt{x}$ with the centroid calculated in Mathematica. Printed with no walls and 100% infill with the goal of actually having a well-balanced shape

### Fourth Project - Washer Method Vase:
- Like solid of revolution but uses the washer method. The function $x^2$ is subtracted from $x + 2\sin{x} + 1$. I had to do some work in Fusion 360 to make the Mathematica output 3D-printable.
- I have also stretched the vase vertically to make it more practical. (see SolidRevVase ... taller.3mf)

### Fifth Project - Cycloid and Brachistochrone Marble Runs
- I did not use Mathematica for this project but rather used the Desmos graphing calculator to generate SVG files that I imported into TinkerCAD to model the ramps for the marble run.
- One of the runs is a simple cycloid curve where if two marbles are dropped from any point on both sides, they will meet in the middle at the same time.
- The second marble run is a demonstration of the Brachistochrone curve, which has the shortest travel time compared to the two other ramps.
