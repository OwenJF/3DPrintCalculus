## 3D Printing Projects for my Calculus II Class

### First Project - SinPlot - Reimann Sum:
  - This project is a 3D representation of the Reimann sum of a sin plot. I changed the parameters from the original Mathematica code to create three different versions of the sin plot, each with a different number of rectangles for the Reimann sum.

### Second Project - Solid of Revolution/Shells:
- This project is a 3D representation of a solid of revolution. This code can generate the exact solid, represent the disk method, or generate both. I used the code to generate both 3D shapes. I repaired 3D objects in Fusion 360 then added text in TinkerCad before printing.

### Third Project - Centroid Center of Mass:
- Extrusion of function $y=\sqrt{x}$ with the centroid calculated in Mathematica. Printed with no walls and 100% infill to actually have a well-balanced shape. Unfortunately, this project did not work out as hoped.

### Fourth Project - Washer Method Vase:
- Like solid of revolution but uses the washer method. The function $x^2$ is subtracted from $x + 2\sin{x} + 1$. I had to do some work in Fusion 360 to make the Mathematica output 3D-printable.
- I have also stretched the vase vertically to make it more practical. (see SolidRevVase ... taller.3mf)

### Fifth Project - Cycloid and Brachistochrone Marble Runs
- I did not use Mathematica for this project but rather used the Desmos graphing calculator to generate SVG files that I imported into TinkerCAD to model the ramps for the marble run.
- One of the runs is a simple cycloid curve where if two marbles are dropped from any point on both sides, they will meet in the middle at the same time.
- The second marble run is a demonstration of the Brachistochrone curve, which has the shortest travel time compared to the two other ramps.

### Sixth Project - Convergent Series Puzzle
- This puzzle was designed in TinkerCAD. It features several square pieces that fit into the base, each piece is half the size of another piece. The size of the pieces are based on the geometric series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}^n$
